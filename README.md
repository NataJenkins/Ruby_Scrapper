- This is a web scraper that grabs a page with different series and picks the last episodes and displays them in an HTML format.
- It was created in the necessity that I expend to much time trying to search for one episode with all the adds
- I like dark mode and the page didn't support it, so I create a new page with only the necessary information and in dark mode
